<h1>Welcome to Marental!</h1>

<p>Marental is a web application that we created during our internship project. Our team aimed to create a manga rental service that is accessible to both young and adult audiences. The project helped us improve our teamwork skills, which is essential in the programming industry. Additionally, it was an opportunity for us to enhance our coding skills and gain professional experience.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Our goal was to create a platform where users could rent manga books and read them without having to purchase them. We also aimed to give our users the ability to add and remove rented items, create user accounts, and communicate with the server for registration and login.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Our web application is self-sufficient, which means that users don't need to install any software on their computers to use it. All they need is an internet connection and a web browser.</p>
